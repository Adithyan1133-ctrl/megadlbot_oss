Introduction:
Megatron was a telegram file management bot that helped a lot of users, specially movie channel managers to upload
their files to telegram by just providing a link to it. The project initially started as roanuedhuru_bot which lately
retired and came back as Megatron which was a side project of the
famous Maldivian Telegram community - @Baivaru until it retired.

Hello!!! its been a while, lets get started... today I am very excited... lemme show u why:
a promise is a promise... I told u once I reach 100 subs I will share the source of the project on github
also do a video with instructions on how to deploy it on your environment... well thats exactly what
I am going to do,
I have already got my testbench up and running on digital ocean... and its ubuntu... we had done the whole
development on windows, and also I shared every step on how and what I did through out the whole series, so
I believe I have already given u instructions on how it can be deployed on windows lol...
ok without a further delay lets jump in to the agenda...

there u go, the source is on github now, well what a messy video it has been... either way, with that being
done, here we also found out that we do have to do a better system in handling floodwait, anyway this
has been a good journey together, lets continue fix all that too... well for today lets conclude the video..
have a nice day ahead :-)
