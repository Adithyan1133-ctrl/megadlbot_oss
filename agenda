Introduction:
Megatron was a telegram file management bot that helped a lot of users, specially movie channel managers to upload
their files to telegram by just providing a link to it. The project initially started as roanuedhuru_bot which lately
retired and came back as Megatron which was a side project of the
famous Maldivian Telegram community - @Baivaru until it retired.
